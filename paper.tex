\section{Proposed Method}
\label{proposed-method}

The proposed method is designed to accelerate the convergence of the
PSO algorithm. The hypothesis that was taken into consideration for this method is
that extending PSO to a parallel architecture should increase the
position diversity of the particles, and avoid premature convergence around a local
optimum and should yield better results because of this, as explained
by S. Cheng in \cite{cheng2013population}. Furthermore, each device in the parallel
architecture that is searching for a solution is configured with a
random set of parameters, as proposed by Y. Gong and
A. Fukunaga in \cite{gong2011distributed}. The intention of this approach is to
replace an optimization process of the parameters for a single instance of
an evolutionary algorithm, and, instead, use a number of instances with
different random parameters.  %Don't understand this - JJ
As has been demonstrated in practice, as
in \cite{garcia2014randomized}, \cite{gong2011distributed}, and
\cite{tanabe2013evaluation}, this approach obtains similar results to
an evolutionary algorithm with optimised parameters. % This probably
                                % should go to state of the art - JJ

The PSO algorithm was adapted to integrate it with the EvoSpace
architecture \cite{garcia2015evospace}. EvoSpace enables different
instances of PSO to be working on a single population, taking random
samples of particles.
